		<h1>cmb524's ECE 5160 Laboratory (LAB 402)</h1>
		<p>Hi, I'm Chris Bakhos. This is supposed to be a small introduction, but I'm not sure if it's an introduction to me or to this website. So I will do both. I am an ECE M.Eng. student. I did my undergraduate at Cornell as well. I am an active member of Cornell Catholic, and I am interested in learning Spanish. In terms of this website, I will be posting my labs here. <a href="whyplaintext.html">Why plaintext for this website?</a></p>
