		<p>Alas, my friends, this semester has been the death of me. Or, perhaps more accurately, my inability to handle the stress and workload of the semester has brought me to the point of not finishing many of my labs, and it has taken me so long to finish <a href="lab7.html">lab 7</a> that I have completely missed lab 8. I have been advised to start work on <a href="lab9.html">lab 9</a> so as to have the arena available to me instead of working on lab 8. So, that is what I am doing here. Feel free to carry onto the next lab, and I hope I am able to catch up enough so as to work on lab 8 and finish it soon enough.</p>
