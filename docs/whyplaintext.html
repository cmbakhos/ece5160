		<h1>Why Plaintext?</h1>
		<p>Please excuse this rant, I had perhaps a bit too much fun making it.</p>
		<p>Websites have become quite burdensome and in my opinion, overly-beautified. And I do feel there is a time and a place for that. It can certainly take a load of talent to design such beautiful websites. However, I honestly think most of the situations this is done in are quite unnecessary and honestly make the internet experience much more burdensome (which perhaps could be a good thing, as I really should be on the internet less).</p>
		<p>How many times have we wanted to just find something out, only to be bombarded about accepting cookies, then being asked to subscribe to their newsletter, to then turn down the chat with their support team in that little interface in the bottom-right corner (the one that never quite goes away), only then to have to pause that video advertizement that plays before the mini-video you didn't really ask for, before being faced with a dozen advertizements littered throughout the webpage, trying to manipulate you into buying things, all the while you have to deal with that banner that takes up one-fourth of the screen whenever you scroll up a few pixels. None of this is to mention how difficult it is to load these webpages on a slow connection or an old computer.</p>
		<p>Not that this website would, in its theoretically pretty form, do even close to half of that (nor do I currently have the skills to design a website like that), but I want to actively go against the internet culture that has lead to this.</p>
